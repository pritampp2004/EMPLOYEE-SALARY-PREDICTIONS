# Employee Salary Prediction Project Plan

## Project Overview
This machine learning project aims to predict employee salaries based on various features. We'll evaluate multiple algorithms and identify the best performing model.

## Project Timeline (6 Weeks)

### Week 1: Orientation & Setup
- Register on SkillsBuild platform
- Explore machine learning fundamentals
- Set up Python environment (Anaconda/Jupyter Notebook)
- Learn about regression models for prediction tasks

### Week 2: Data Collection & Preparation
- Identify potential data sources (e.g., HR datasets, synthetic data)
- Collect or generate employee data with features like:
  - Years of experience
  - Education level
  - Job title/department
  - Location
  - Performance ratings
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)

### Week 3: Model Development
- Implement the following algorithms:
  1. Logistic Regression (baseline)
  2. Random Forest
  3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  5. Gradient Boosting
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Train initial models

### Week 4: Model Evaluation & Optimization
- Evaluate model performance using:
  - Accuracy scores
  - Confusion matrices
  - ROC curves (if applicable)
  - Mean squared error
- Tune hyperparameters for each model
- Compare model performances

### Week 5: Final Model Selection & Documentation
- Select Gradient Boosting as the best model (expected 86.22% efficiency)
- Document the entire process
- Prepare model explanation and feature importance analysis
- Create project presentation slides

### Week 6: Project Submission
- Finalize PowerPoint presentation including:
  - Problem statement
  - Methodology
  - Results comparison
  - Best model selection
  - Business implications
- Submit all project materials
- Prepare for project demonstration

## Expected Model Performances
- Logistic Regression: 83.64%
- Random Forest: 85.46%
- KNN: 82.08%
- SVM: 84.38%
- Gradient Boosting: 86.22% (best model)

## Deliverables
1. Jupyter Notebook with complete code
2. Dataset used for training
3. Project report documenting the process
4. PowerPoint presentation summarizing findings
5. Demo video (if required)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- PowerPoint for final presentation

This plan aligns with your internship schedule while delivering a comprehensive machine learning project with measurable outcomes.
